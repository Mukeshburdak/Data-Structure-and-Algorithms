# ğŸ“‚ Doubly Linked List Programs in C

This folder contains **C implementations of Doubly Linked List (Two-way Linked List)**.  
These programs demonstrate how to **create, traverse, search, insert, and delete** elements in a doubly linked list.

---

## ğŸ“Œ Programs Included

1. **Creating a Doubly Linked List from the Beginning**  
   - Inserts new nodes at the **start** of the list.  
   - Traversal shown in **forward direction**.

2. **Creating a Doubly Linked List from the End**  
   - Appends new nodes at the **end** of the list.  
   - Traversal shown in **forward direction**.

3. **Searching in a Doubly Linked List**  
   - Searches for a given element in the list.  
   - Prints its position if found, otherwise "Not Found".

4. **Deletion in a Doubly Linked List**  
   - Deletes a node from the list at a **given location**.  
   - Ensures proper re-linking of previous and next nodes.

5. **Insertion in a Doubly Linked List (After a Given Location)**  
   - Inserts a new node **after a specified position**.  
   - Demonstrates pointer manipulation for node linking.
