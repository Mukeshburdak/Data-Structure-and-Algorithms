🧭 DSA Roadmap (Beginner → Advanced)
-

A clean roadmap for learning DSA step by step:

1️⃣ Foundation
-

Learn C basics (loops, functions, pointers)

Understand memory (stack, heap)

2️⃣ Core Data Structures
-

Arrays

Linked Lists

Stack & Queue

3️⃣ Searching & Sorting
-

Linear / Binary Search

Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion)

4️⃣ Trees
-

Binary Tree

Binary Search Tree

Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)

5️⃣ Advanced Concepts
-

Recursion

Time & Space Complexity

Hashing (future update)

Graph Theory (future update)


This repo helps you through all early–mid stages of DSA.
