# 📘 Data Structures and Algorithms in C  

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** repository 🚀.  
This repo contains well-structured implementations of important DSA topics in **C language**, organized into separate folders for easy navigation.  

The aim is to provide **clean, beginner-friendly, and interview-oriented** code examples with supporting documentation.

## 📂 Repository Structure  

### 🔹 1. Arrays  
- Basic problems like factorial, Fibonacci, array operations.  
- Programs include:  
  - Sum of array elements  
  - Insert/Delete elements  
  - Linear & Binary Search  
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Largest & Second Largest element  

📂 Folder: `Arrays/`

---

### 🔹 2. Linked List  
- Covers **Singly Linked List** (creation, traversal, insertion, deletion, sorting, searching, merging).  
- **Doubly Linked List** (creation from beginning/end, insertion, deletion, searching).  
- Circular linked list implementation.  

📂 Folder: `LinkedList/`

---

### 🔹 3. Stack  
- Different stack implementations:  
  - Stack using Array  
  - Stack using Linked List  
  - Stack using Functions (Linked List based)  

📂 Folder: `Stack/`

---

### 🔹 4. Queue  
- Implementations of:  
  - Queue using Array  
  - Queue using Linked List  
  - Sorting Queue elements  
  - Priority Queue insertion  

📂 Folder: `Queue/`

---

### 🔹 5. Sorting Algorithms  
- Classical sorting techniques:  
  - Insertion Sort  
  - Selection Sort  

📂 Folder: `Sorting/`

---

### 🔹 6. Trees  
- Programs for **Binary Tree** and **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:  
  - Creation of Binary Tree  
  - Inorder Traversal  
  - Preorder Traversal  
  - Postorder Traversal  

📂 Folder: `Tree/`
